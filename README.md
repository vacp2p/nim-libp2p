## Background

libp2p is a [Peer-to-Peer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer) networking stack, with [implementations](https://github.com/libp2p/libp2p#implementations) in multiple languages derived from the same [specifications.](https://github.com/libp2p/specs)

Building large scale peer-to-peer systems has been complex and difficult in the last 15 years and libp2p is a way to fix that. It strives to be a modular stack with secure defaults and useful protocols, while remaining open and extensible.
This is a native Nim implementation, using [chronos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos) for asynchronous execution. It's used in production by a few [projects](#users).

Learn more about libp2p at [**libp2p.io**](https://libp2p.io) and follow libp2p's documentation [**docs.libp2p.io**](https://docs.libp2p.io).

## Contribute

nim-libp2p is a great place to contribute. Your contribution will help drive thousands of decentralized nodes across networks worldwide.

The best part is that nim-libp2p has **good first issues** that are especially suited for newcomers. Your contributions will be guided by core maintainers, just like an **internship experience** but decentralized.

Jump into the [contributing](docs/contributing.md) page to get started, `nim-libp2p` is expecting your contribution!

## Install

The currently supported Nim versions are v2.0.16 and v2.2.6.

```
nimble install libp2p
```

You'll find the nim-libp2p documentation [here](https://vacp2p.github.io/nim-libp2p/docs/). See [examples](./examples) for simple usage patterns.

## Development

See the [development guide](docs/development.md) to get started with the project and testing.
For more details, refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md).

## Stability

nim-libp2p has been used in production for many years in high-stake scenarios, so its core is considered stable.
Some modules are more recent and less stable.

The versioning follows [semver](https://semver.org/), with some additions:

- Some of libp2p procedures are marked as `.public.`, they will remain compatible during each `MAJOR` version
- The rest of the procedures are considered internal, and can change at any `MINOR` version (but remain compatible for each new `PATCH`)
