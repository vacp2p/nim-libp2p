## # Tron example
##
## In this tutorial, we will create a video game based on libp2p, using
## all of the features we talked about in the last tutorials.
##
## We will:
## - Discover peers using the Discovery Manager
## - Use GossipSub to find a play mate
## - Create a custom protocol to play with him
##
## While this may look like a daunting project, it's less than 150 lines of code.
##
## The game will be a simple Tron. We will use [nico](https://github.com/ftsf/nico)
## as a game engine. (you need to run `nimble install nico` to have it available)

##
## We will start by importing our dependencies and creating our types
import os
import nico, chronos, stew/byteutils, stew/endians2
import libp2p
import libp2p/protocols/rendezvous
import libp2p/discovery/rendezvousinterface
import libp2p/discovery/discoverymngr

const
  directions = @[(K_UP, 0, -1), (K_LEFT, -1, 0), (K_DOWN, 0, 1), (K_RIGHT, 1, 0)]
  mapSize = 32
  tickPeriod = 0.2

type
  Player = ref object
    x, y: int
    currentDir, nextDir: int
    lost: bool
    color: int

  Game = ref object
    gameMap: array[mapSize * mapSize, int]
    tickTime: float
    localPlayer, remotePlayer: Player
    peerFound: Future[Connection]
    hasCandidate: bool
    tickFinished: Future[int]

  GameProto = ref object of LPProtocol

proc new(_: type[Game]): Game =
  # Default state of a game
  result = Game(
    tickTime: -3.0, # 3 seconds of "warm-up" time
    localPlayer: Player(x: 4, y: 16, currentDir: 3, nextDir: 3, color: 8),
    remotePlayer: Player(x: 27, y: 16, currentDir: 1, nextDir: 1, color: 12),
    peerFound: newFuture[Connection]()
  )
  for pos in 0 .. result.gameMap.high:
    if pos mod mapSize in [0, mapSize - 1] or pos div mapSize in [0, mapSize - 1]:
      result.gameMap[pos] = 7

## ## Game Logic
## The networking during the game will work like this:
##
## * Each player will have `tickPeriod` (0.1) seconds to choose
##   a direction that he wants to go to (default to current direction)
## * After `tickPeriod`, we will send our choosen direction to the peer,
##   and wait for his direction
## * Once we have both direction, we will "tick" the game, and restart the
##   loop, as long as both player are alive.
##
## This is a very simplistic scheme, but creating proper networking for
## video games is an [art](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization)
##
## The main drawback of this scheme is that the more ping you have with
## the peer, the slower the game will run. Or invertedly, the less ping you
## have, the faster it runs!
proc update(g: Game, dt: float32) =
  # Will be called at each frame of the game.
  #
  # Because both Nico and Chronos have a main loop,
  # they must share the control of the main thread.
  # This is a hacky way to make this happen
  waitFor(sleepAsync(1.milliseconds))
  # Don't do anything if we are still waiting for an opponent
  if not(g.peerFound.finished()) or isNil(g.tickFinished): return
  g.tickTime += dt

  # Update the wanted direction, making sure we can't go backward
  for i in 0 .. directions.high:
    if i != (g.localPlayer.currentDir + 2 mod 4) and keyp(directions[i][0]):
      g.localPlayer.nextDir = i

  if g.tickTime > tickPeriod and not g.tickFinished.finished():
    # We choosen our next direction, let the networking know
    g.localPlayer.currentDir = g.localPlayer.nextDir
    g.tickFinished.complete(g.localPlayer.currentDir)

proc tick(g: Game, p: Player) =
  # Move player and check if he lost
  p.x += directions[p.currentDir][1]
  p.y += directions[p.currentDir][2]
  if g.gameMap[p.y * mapSize + p.x] != 0: p.lost = true
  g.gameMap[p.y * mapSize + p.x] = p.color

proc mainLoop(g: Game, peer: Connection) {.async.} =
  while not (g.localPlayer.lost or g.remotePlayer.lost):
    if g.tickTime > 0.0:
      g.tickTime = 0
    g.tickFinished = newFuture[int]()

    # Wait for a choosen direction
    let dir = await g.tickFinished
    # Send it
    await peer.writeLp(toBytes(uint32(dir)))

    # Get the one from the peer
    g.remotePlayer.currentDir = int uint32.fromBytes(await peer.readLp(8))
    # Tick the players & restart
    g.tick(g.remotePlayer)
    g.tick(g.localPlayer)

## We'll draw the map & put some texts when necessary:
proc draw(g: Game) =
  for pos, color in g.gameMap:
    setColor(color)
    boxFill(pos mod 32 * 4, pos div 32 * 4, 4, 4)
  let text = if not(g.peerFound.finished()): "Matchmaking.."
             elif g.tickTime < -1.5: "Welcome to Etron"
             elif g.tickTime < 0.0: "- " & $(int(abs(g.tickTime) / 0.5) + 1) & " -"
             elif g.remotePlayer.lost and g.localPlayer.lost: "DEUCE"
             elif g.localPlayer.lost: "YOU LOOSE"
             elif g.remotePlayer.lost: "YOU WON"
             else: ""
  printc(text, screenWidth div 2, screenHeight div 2)


## ## Matchmaking
## To find an opponent, we will broadcast our address on a
## GossipSub topic, and wait for someone to connect to us.
## We will also listen to that topic, and connect to anyone
## broadcasting his address.
##
## If we are looking for a game, we'll send `ok` to let the
## peer know that we are available, check that he is also available,
## and launch the game.
