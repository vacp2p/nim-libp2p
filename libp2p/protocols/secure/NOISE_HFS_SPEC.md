# NoiseHFS: post-quantum hybrid Noise for nim-libp2p

Status: experimental. Protocol identifier `/noise-mlkem768-hfs/0.1.0` is a
working identifier, not yet registered with libp2p-specs or IANA.

## Motivation

The classical `/noise` handshake (`Noise_XX_25519_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`) relies
on X25519, which is broken by Shor's algorithm on a sufficiently large
quantum computer. Traffic recorded today can be decrypted retroactively once
such hardware exists (store-now-decrypt-later). `NoiseHFS` adds a
post-quantum key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) alongside the existing X25519
Diffie-Hellman exchange, so the session stays confidential even if either
component is later broken, without dropping backward compatibility: a
hybrid-capable node can mount both `NoiseHFS` and `Noise`, and multistream-select
negotiates the best protocol either side supports.

## Algorithm suite

`Noise_XXhfs_25519+ML-KEM-768_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`

| Primitive | Choice |
|---|---|
| Classical DH | X25519 |
| PQC KEM | ML-KEM-768 (FIPS 203), raw - no composite/combiner wrapper |
| AEAD | ChaCha20-Poly1305 |
| Hash | SHA-256 |

Raw ML-KEM-768 is used instead of a composite KEM (e.g. X-Wing) because the
XXhfs pattern's three DH tokens (`ee`, `es`, `se`) already provide classical
security; embedding a second X25519 operation inside the KEM slot would be
redundant. This mirrors the analysis in `NOISE-HFS` and in the reference
implementations this profile was designed to be wire-compatible with
(ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise PR #665, libp2p/py-libp2p PR #1310, and
royzah/rust-libp2p PR #1 as of the June 2026 3-way interop test - see
"Interoperability status" below for the current state of that alignment).

## Handshake pattern

Applying the Noise HFS extension (`e1`/`ekem1` tokens) to the classical XX
pattern:

```
Noise_XXhfs_25519+ML-KEM-768_ChaChaPoly_SHA256:

  -> e, e1
  <- e, ee, ekem1, s, es
  -> s, se
```

This keeps XX's three-message structure - no extra round trip versus a pure
post-quantum KEM pattern (e.g. PQNoise's `pqXX`, which needs four messages
because KEM is inherently asymmetric).

| Token | Operation |
|---|---|
| `e` | Generate/send X25519 ephemeral public key |
| `e1` | Generate/send ML-KEM-768 ephemeral encapsulation key |
| `ee` | `MixKey(DH(e_local, e_remote))` |
| `ekem1` | Encapsulate to `re1`; `EncryptAndHash(ciphertext)` then `MixKey(sharedSecret)` |
| `s` | Encrypt and send X25519 static public key |
| `es` | `MixKey(DH(e, rs))` if initiator, `MixKey(DH(s, re))` if responder |
| `se` | `MixKey(DH(s, re))` if initiator, `MixKey(DH(e, rs))` if responder |

### Wire format (empty `NoiseHandshakePayload`)

```
Message A (initiator -> responder):
  [32 B]   e.publicKey                       (plaintext)
  [1184 B] e1.publicKey (ML-KEM-768 ek)       (plaintext)
  [0 B]    payload

Message B (responder -> initiator):
  [32 B]   e.publicKey                       (plaintext)
  [1104 B] EncryptAndHash(ekem1 ciphertext)   (1088 B ct + 16 B AEAD tag)
  [48 B]   EncryptAndHash(s.publicKey)        (32 B key + 16 B AEAD tag)
  [var]    EncryptAndHash(payload)

Message C (initiator -> responder):
  [48 B]   EncryptAndHash(s.publicKey)
  [var]    EncryptAndHash(payload)
```

Total overhead versus classical XX with an empty payload: 192 B -> 2,480 B
(+2,288 B), entirely in messages A and B.

### `ekem1` token ordering

The responder's `ekem1` step must run in exactly this order:

```
1. (ciphertext, sharedSecret) = Encapsulate(re1)
2. ekem1Bytes = EncryptAndHash(ciphertext)   # under the ee-derived key
3. MixKey(sharedSecret)                      # AFTER encrypting the ciphertext
```

and the initiator's read side mirrors it:

```
1. ciphertext = DecryptAndHash(ekem1Bytes)
2. sharedSecret = Decapsulate(ciphertext, e1.privateKey)
3. MixKey(sharedSecret)
```

Swapping steps 2 and 3 on either side produces divergent chaining keys and
breaks the handshake. The ordering ensures the responder's static key (`s`)
and Message B's payload are protected by a key derived from both `ee` and the
KEM shared secret, not `ee` alone.

### ML-KEM-768 implicit rejection

Per FIPS 203 6.4, `Decaps()` never fails, even for a ciphertext produced for
a different key - it returns a pseudorandom shared secret derived from an
implicit rejection value instead. A tampered or mismatched ciphertext
therefore does not raise at the KEM layer; the resulting divergent shared
secret causes every subsequent AEAD operation to fail authentication instead,
so the handshake still aborts. Because the ciphertext itself is AEAD-tagged
before `MixKey` runs, outright tampering is caught by that tag before
decapsulation is even attempted.

## Implementation

- `libp2p/crypto/mlkem768.nim` - raw ML-KEM-768 bound directly to the
  `MLKEM768_*` C API already vendored into nim-libp2p through its
  `boringssl` dependency (`crypto/mlkem/mlkem.cc`), rather than pulling in a
  separate PQC library. This is the same ML-KEM-768 implementation shipped in
  Chrome's TLS stack.
- `libp2p/protocols/secure/noisehfs.nim` - the `NoiseHFS` connection
  encrypter. Reuses `noise.nim`'s `SymmetricState`/`CipherState`/`KeyPair`
  and message framing unchanged (`readFrame`, `sendHSMessage`, `dh`,
  `mixKey`, `mixHash`, `encryptAndHash`, `decryptAndHash`, `split`); only the
  `e1`/`ekem1` token handling and the top-level connection encrypter are new.
- `libp2p/builders.nim` - `SecureProtocol.NoiseHFS` and
  `SwitchBuilder.withNoiseHFS()`, so a switch can mount `NoiseHFS` alongside
  the default `Noise` and let multistream-select negotiate per peer.

## Interoperability status

This profile's wire format was designed to match
`Noise_XXhfs_25519+ML-KEM-768_ChaChaPoly_SHA256` as published in "Post-Quantum
Cryptography Integration into the Noise Protocol" (Okwuosa, 2026), which
reports a 3-way interop test between TypeScript (ChainSafe/js-libp2p-noise PR
#665), Python (libp2p/py-libp2p PR #1310), and Rust (royzah/rust-libp2p PR
#1) all completing pairwise handshakes on raw ML-KEM-768.

This nim-libp2p implementation has been verified standalone (KEM round-trip,
implicit-rejection behavior, and a full two-node TCP handshake with peer
authentication - see `tests/libp2p/protocols/test_noisehfs.nim`), but has
**not yet** been live-tested against those other implementations. While
preparing this, the locally available `py-libp2p` PQC branch
(`feat/pqc-noise-xxhfs`) turned out to still implement the earlier X-Wing
composite KEM design (`Noise_XXhfs_25519+XWing_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`, protocol
id `/noise-pq/1.0.0`) rather than the raw-ML-KEM-768 profile the published
paper describes, so a live run against it would not be a meaningful
wire-compatibility check. Live interop against implementations confirmed to
be on the raw-ML-KEM-768 revision is the recommended next step before this
protocol identifier is considered stable.
