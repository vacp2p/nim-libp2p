  WildcardAddressResolverService* = ref object of Service
    ## Service used to resolve wildcard addresses of the type "0.0.0.0" for IPv4 or "::" for IPv6.
    ## When used with a `Switch`, this service will be automatically set up and stopped
    ## when the switch starts and stops. This is facilitated by adding the service to the switch's
    ## list of services using the `.withServices(@[svc])` method in the `SwitchBuilder`.
    networkInterfaceProvider: NetworkInterfaceProvider
    ## Provides a list of network addresses.
    addressMapper: AddressMapper
    ## An implementation of an address mapper that takes a list of listen addresses and expands each wildcard address
    ## to the respective list of interface addresses. As an example, if the listen address is 0.0.0.0:4001
    ## and the machine has 2 interfaces with IPs 172.217.11.174 and 64.233.177.113, the address mapper will
    ## expand the wildcard address to 172.217.11.174:4001 and 64.233.177.113:4001.

  ## interfaces and filters them to match the provided address family.

  ## Parameters:
  ## - `addrFamily`: The address family to filter the network addresses (e.g., `AddressFamily.IPv4` or `AddressFamily.IPv6`).

  ## Returns:
  ## - A sequence of `InterfaceAddress` objects that match the specified address family.
