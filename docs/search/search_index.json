The address is in the MultiAddress format. The port <code>0</code> means \"take any port available\".</p> <p><code>tryGet</code> is procedure which is part of nim-result, that will throw an exception if the supplied MultiAddress is invalid.</p> <p>We can now create our two switches: <pre><code>  let\n    switch1 = createSwitch(localAddress, rng)\n    switch2 = createSwitch(localAddress, rng)\n\n  switch1.mount(pingProtocol)\n\n  await switch1.start()\n  await switch2.start()\n</code></pre> We've mounted the <code>pingProtocol</code> on our first switch. This means that the first switch will actually listen for any ping requests coming in, and handle them accordingly.</p> <p>Now that we've started the nodes, they are listening for incoming peers. We can find out which port was attributed, and the resulting local addresses, by using <code>switch1.peerInfo.addrs</code>.</p> <p>We'll dial the first switch from the second one, by specifying its Peer ID, its MultiAddress and the <code>Ping</code> protocol codec: <pre><code>  let conn =\n    await switch2.dial(switch1.peerInfo.peerId, switch1.peerInfo.addrs, PingCodec)\n</code></pre> We now have a <code>Ping</code> connection setup between the second and the first switch, we can use it to actually ping the node: <pre><code>  # ping the other node and echo the ping duration\n  echo \"ping: \", await pingProtocol.ping(conn)\n\n  # We must close the connection ourselves when we're done with it\n  await conn.close()\n</code></pre> And that's it! Just a little bit of cleanup: shutting down the switches, waiting for them to stop, and we'll call our <code>main</code> procedure: <pre><code>  await allFutures(switch1.stop(), switch2.stop())\n    # close connections and shutdown all transports\n\nwaitFor(main())\n</code></pre> You can now run this program using <code>nim c -r part1.nim</code>, and you should see the dialing sequence, ending with a ping output.</p> <p>In the next tutorial, we'll look at how to create our own custom protocol.</p>"},{"location":"tutorial_2_customproto/","title":"Custom protocol in libp2p","text":"<p>In the previous tutorial, we've looked at how to create a simple ping program using the <code>nim-libp2p</code>.</p> <p>We'll now look at how to create a custom protocol inside the libp2p</p> <p>Let's create a <code>part2.nim</code>, and import our dependencies: <pre><code>import chronos\nimport stew/byteutils\n\nimport libp2p\n</code></pre> This is similar to the first tutorial, except we don't need to import the <code>Ping</code> protocol.</p> <p>Next, we'll declare our custom protocol <pre><code>const TestCodec = \"/test/proto/1.0.0\"\n\ntype TestProto = ref object of LPProtocol\n</code></pre> We've set a protocol ID, and created a custom <code>LPProtocol</code>. In a more complex protocol, we could use this structure to store interesting variables.</p> <p>A protocol generally has two parts: a handling/server part, and a dialing/client part. These two parts can be identical, but in our trivial protocol, the server will wait for a message from the client, and the client will send a message, so we have to handle the two cases separately.</p> <p>Let's start with the server part: <pre><code>proc new(T: typedesc[TestProto]): T =\n  # every incoming connections will in be handled in this closure\n  proc handle(conn: Connection, proto: string) {.async: (raises: [CancelledError]).} =\n    # Read up to 1024 bytes from this connection, and transform them into\n    # a string\n    try:\n      echo \"Got from remote - \", string.fromBytes(await conn.readLp(1024))\n    except CancelledError as e:\n      raise e\n    except CatchableError as e:\n      echo \"exception in handler\", e.msg\n    finally:\n      await conn.close()\n\n  return T.new(codecs = @[TestCodec], handler = handle)\n</code></pre> This is a constructor for our <code>TestProto</code>, that will specify our <code>codecs</code> and a <code>handler</code>, which will be called for each incoming peer asking for this protocol. In our handle, we simply read a message from the connection and <code>echo</code> it.</p> <p>We can now create our client part: <pre><code>proc hello(p: TestProto, conn: Connection) {.async.} =\n  await conn.writeLp(\"Hello p2p!\")\n</code></pre> Again, pretty straightforward, we just send a message on the connection.</p> <p>We can now create our main procedure: <pre><code>proc main() {.async.} =\n  let\n    rng = newRng()\n    testProto = TestProto.new()\n    switch1 = newStandardSwitch(rng = rng)\n    switch2 = newStandardSwitch(rng = rng)\n\n  switch1.mount(testProto)\n\n  await switch1.start()\n  await switch2.start()\n\n  let conn =\n    await switch2.dial(switch1.peerInfo.peerId, switch1.peerInfo.addrs, TestCodec)\n\n  await testProto.hello(conn)\n\n  # We must close the connection ourselves when we're done with it\n  await conn.close()\n\n  await allFutures(switch1.stop(), switch2.stop())\n    # close connections and shutdown all transports\n</code></pre> This is very similar to the first tutorial's <code>main</code>, the only noteworthy difference is that we use <code>newStandardSwitch</code>, which is similar to the <code>createSwitch</code> of the first tutorial, but is bundled directly in libp2p</p> <p>We can now wrap our program by calling our main proc: <pre><code>waitFor(main())\n</code></pre> And that's it!

For this example, we'll create a bootnode, and then every peer will advertise itself on the bootnode, and use it to find other peers <pre><code>proc main() {.async.} =\n  let bootNode = createSwitch()\n  await bootNode.start()\n\n  # Create 5 nodes in the network\n  var\n    switches: seq[Switch] = @[]\n    discManagers: seq[DiscoveryManager] = @[]\n\n  for i in 0 .. 5:\n    let rdv = RendezVous.new()\n    # Create a remote future to await at the end of the program\n    let switch = createSwitch(rdv)\n    switch.mount(DumbProto.new(i))\n    switches.add(switch)\n\n    # A discovery manager is a simple tool, you can set it up by adding discovery\n    # interfaces (such as RendezVousInterface) then you can use it to advertise\n    # something on the network or to request something from it.\n    let dm = DiscoveryManager()\n    # A RendezVousInterface is a RendezVous protocol wrapped to be usable by the\n    # DiscoveryManager.\n    dm.add(RendezVousInterface.new(rdv))\n    discManagers.add(dm)\n\n    # We can now start the switch and connect to the bootnode\n    await switch.start()\n    await switch.connect(bootNode.peerInfo.peerId, bootNode.peerInfo.addrs)\n\n    # Each nodes of the network will advertise on some topics (EvenGang or OddClub)\n    dm.advertise(RdvNamespace(if i mod 2 == 0: \"EvenGang\" else: \"OddClub\"))\n</code></pre> We can now create the newcomer. This peer will connect to the boot node, and use it to discover peers &amp; greet them.</p> <pre><code>  let\n    rdv = RendezVous.new()\n    newcomer = createSwitch(rdv)\n    dm = DiscoveryManager()\n  await newcomer.start()\n  await newcomer.connect(bootNode.peerInfo.peerId, bootNode.peerInfo.addrs)\n  dm.add(RendezVousInterface.new(rdv, ttr = 250.milliseconds))\n\n  # Use the discovery manager to find peers on the OddClub topic to greet them\n  let queryOddClub = dm.request(RdvNamespace(\"OddClub\"))\n  for _ in 0 .. 2:\n    let\n      # getPeer give you a PeerAttribute containing informations about the peer.\n      res = await queryOddClub.getPeer()\n      # Here we will use the PeerId and the MultiAddress to greet him\n      conn = await newcomer.dial(res[PeerId], res.getAll(MultiAddress), DumbCodec)\n    await conn.writeLp(\"Odd Club suuuucks! Even Gang is better!\")\n    # Uh-oh!\n    await conn.close()\n    # Wait for the peer to close the stream\n    await conn.join()\n  # Queries will run in a loop, so we must stop them when we are done\n  queryOddClub.stop()\n\n  # Maybe it was because he wanted to join the EvenGang\n  let queryEvenGang = dm.request(RdvNamespace(\"EvenGang\"))\n  for _ in 0 .. 2:\n    let\n      res = await queryEvenGang.getPeer()\n      conn = await newcomer.dial(res[PeerId], res.getAll(MultiAddress), DumbCodec)\n    await conn.writeLp(\"Even Gang is sooo laaame! Odd Club rocks!\")\n    # Or maybe not...\n    await conn.close()\n    await conn.join()\n  queryEvenGang.stop()\n  # What can I say, some people just want to watch the world burn... Anyway\n\n  # Stop all the discovery managers\n  for d in discManagers:\n    d.stop()\n  dm.stop()\n\n  # Stop all the switches\n  await allFutures(switches.mapIt(it.stop()))\n  await allFutures(bootNode.stop(), newcomer.stop())\n\nwaitFor(main())\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"tutorial_6_game/","title":"Tron example","text":"<p>In this tutorial, we will create a video game based on libp2p, using all of the features we talked about in the last tutorials.</p> <p>We will: - Discover peers using the Discovery Manager - Use GossipSub to find a play mate - Create a custom protocol to play with him</p> <p>While this may look like a daunting project, it's less than 150 lines of code.</p> <p>The game will be a simple Tron.
