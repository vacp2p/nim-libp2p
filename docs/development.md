# Development

Clone the repository and set up local dependencies:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/vacp2p/nim-libp2p
cd nim-libp2p
make
```

`make` is the default local development setup target. It resolves the lowest supported dependency versions for `NIM_VERSION` using Nimble local dependency mode, then writes local dependency paths for the library and tests.

```sh
make setup                 # explicit form of the default target
make NIM_VERSION=2.2.4 setup
make build                 # explicit Nix build
```

Nimble 0.24.0 or newer is required for the min-version resolver. You can use `nix develop` to start a shell with Nim and Nimble; if that shell has an older Nimble, run `nimble install nimble` and use the newer binary, typically `~/.nimble/bin/nimble`.

## Getting Started

### Hello World example

Try to compile and run a simple example to ensure that everything is working on your machine.

```bash
nim c -r examples/helloworld.nim
```

### Chat example

Try out the chat example, where you can chat between two instances.

Run chat example (first instance):

```bash
nim c -r examples/directchat.nim
```

This will output a peer ID such as `QmbmHfVvouKammmQDJck4hz33WvVktNEe7pasxz2HgseRu` which you can use in second instance to connect to it.

Then run chat example again (second instance):

```bash
nim c -r examples/directchat.nim
```

And then use peer ID from first instance to connect to it, by typing in second instance:

```bash
/connect QmbmHfVvouKammmQDJck4hz33WvVktNEe7pasxz2HgseRu # use peer ID from first instance
```

## Testing

Run unit tests:

```sh
# run all the unit tests
make test

# run tests matching a path substring:
# - Directory name: "transports" matches all tests in transports/
# - Partial filename: "quic" matches test_quic.nim, test_quic_stream.nim, etc.
# - Exact filename: "test_ws.nim" matches only that specific file
# - Full path: "libp2p/transports/test_tcp" matches libp2p/transports/test_tcp.nim
make test quic
make test transports/test_ws
# etc ...

# run specific test suites
make test_multiformat_exts
make test_integration
```

For faster iteration during development, you can bypass nimble overhead by compiling the test file directly:

```sh
# compile and run all tests
nim c -r tests/test_all.nim

# compile and run tests matching a path substring
nim c -r -d:path=quic tests/test_all.nim
nim c -r -d:path=transports/test_ws tests/test_all.nim
nim c -r -d:path=mix tests/test_all.nim

# compile and run specific test file
nim c -r tests/tools/test_multiaddress.nim
```

## Formatting code

nim-libp2p uses [nph](https://github.com/arnetheduck/nph) to format code.

Do `nimble install nph@v0.7.0` once to install nph, then `nimble format` (or `nph ./. *.nim`) to format code.

## Logs

nim-libp2p uses [chronicles](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronicles) library for structured logging.

chronicles is configured at compile time. You can adjust the log detail level using compile time flags like this:

```bash
nim c -r -d:chronicles_log_level=error examples/helloworld.nim
```

where `chronicles_log_level` can have following values: `none`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug` and `trace` (values are case-insensitive).

If you are overwhelmed with logs, you can disable topics that aren’t relevant and increase the logging level for the ones that matter most:

`-d:chronicles_enabled_topics:switch:TRACE,quictransport:INFO`
